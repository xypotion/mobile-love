Heart's Desire: Black Ocean (HDBO) outline/brainstorm

game states:
- main menu
- map/level select
- stage
- status screen
- powers selection

process outline:
- ...probably different draws+updates for different game states. that'd be a good start. consider overlays & the ability to draw multiple states together
  - 1 canvas for each?
	- autosave format is also very important. will differ depending on game state

object architecture:
- game
  - stages array
	  - unlocked
		- beaten
  - powers = bool array
	- current powers = power array
- enemy
  - HP
	- strength
	- script?
- stage
  - enemies array
	- reward
	- graphics...
	  - surface = bool
		- floor = bool
		- water color?
- power
  - passive or active? unsure
	
powers brainstorm:
- nudibranch: special attacks do 20% more damage if on seafloor
- urchin: attackers take damage if on seafloor
- jellyfish: attackers take damage if in open ocean
- pistol shrimp: huge damage (1 target), huge cooldown
